# HealthTrack

This is for my personal work in order to create a app/device that can monitor mutiple health factors in an individual
First,this application will be used to track a persons metabolic rate,and then be able to calculate the amount of calories an individual should consume to cut/gain weight.
Next the application will be used,if possible to calculate how many macros a person has ingested(protein, carbs, fats),and based on the persons goals the be able to calculate how
many macros a person needs to reach his/her goals. The starting idea would be for a person to wear a watch that hasa needle of a miniscule size pokethem in the vein to measure these.
This is just the initial idea and can be subject to change based on the feasability of thiis altogether.
